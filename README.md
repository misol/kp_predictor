# Kp predictor
The tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient predictor. The prediction methods were presented by Rodgers and coworkers in [2005](https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.20322), [2006](https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.20502), and [2007](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11095-006-9210-3).

As I feel difficult to type the formulas repeatedly, I try hard not to make a typo and fix it as an web-based calculator.

You can utilize it on https://misol.kr/labs/kp_predictor/.

If there is a request, I may extend this code further.
